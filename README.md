# Analyzing-Hotel-Reviews-System
This repository contains a Python implementation of a system for analyzing hotel reviews. The system is based on the Hotel_Reviews dataset, which is a publicly available dataset of hotel reviews.
The system is implemented using the following Python libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and, NLTK.
The system first cleans the data and removes any null values. It then performs sentiment analysis on the reviews to determine whether they are positive, negative, or neutral. The system also calculates the cosine similarity between different reviews to identify reviews that are similar in content.
The system can be used to:
Identify the most common positive and negative words in hotel reviews
Identify the most common topics in hotel reviews
Find similar reviews
Analyze the sentiment of hotel reviews
The system is still under development, but it is already able to analyze hotel reviews with a high degree of accuracy. I plan to add more features to the system in the future, such as the ability to generate hotel recommendations based on user reviews.
I hope you find this system useful!
